## 🛠 Sister's Web Toolbox

Since you are building a Web Interface now, here are the tools you need:

### 📚 Concepts to Read
* **HTML Forms**: How to send data from a browser to a server.
* **Flask Request Object**: How Python catches the data the browser threw.
* **Jinja2**: How to put Python variables inside HTML.

### 🔍 Search Queries
* *Flask request.form example* (To learn how to get the user's text)
* *How to append to JSON file in Python* (Backend logic)
* *Flask render_template pass variable* (To show the data back to the user)
* *HTML textarea tag*

### 💡 Pro-Tip
When you "print" something in Flask, it doesn't show up on the website! It shows up in your **Terminal** (the black box running the server). Use `print(request.form)` to debug your data before trying to save it!
